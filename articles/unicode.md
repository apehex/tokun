In machine learning, three domains ‚Äîcomputer science, mathematics, and linguistics‚Äî are often at odds.

Each domain handles text in a different form:

- computers deal with raw numbers like byte sequences
- mathematics manipulates tensors and vector
- while linguistics focuses on graphemes (characters) and their combinations (words)

Tokenization has long been used as a bridge, transforming human-readable text into a machine-friendly format.
It relies on algorithms like [BPE][wikipedia-bpe], which draw on human intuition.

In my [previous article][huggingface-tokenization-1], I proposed to let the model itself learn the mapping from raw bytes to embeddings.

However, there's a more straightforward alternative: using Unicode directly as the foundation for embeddings in LLMs.

## TL;DR

Rather than merging encoding bytes outside of the model (BPE, etc), the idea is to **combine elementary embeddings inside the model**.

It can be achieved with small changes to the transformer architecture, on the input and output layers.

### Input Pipeline

The inputs are processed as follows:

- the text is encoded using UTF-32-BE into a sequence of bytes (values in `[0 .. 256[`)
- each byte is embedded independently using a `(256, E)` kernel
- the byte embeddings are merged by groups of size `T`

Starting from the UTF-32-BE bytes, and with `T = 2`:

<img src=".images/composite/embeddings.png" width="100%" style="margin: auto;"/>

`T` and `E` can be **chosen freely**: the token length could be 4, 8 or even 16.
With a matching embedding dimension for the bytes, `T * E` is brought to the model dimension, say 4096.

The bytes can be given independent meaning thanks to the embedding table.
Each one contributes to a specific portion of the final embedding:

<img src=".images/composite/contribution.png" width="100%" style="margin: auto;"/>

And the overall combination pattern holds the information on token composition.

### Output Pipeline

The output layer could be a standard softmax of depth 256 for each byte prediction.

But, instead of evaluating each of the 256 options, it is more efficient to **predict the value, as a vector of 8 bits**:

<img src=".images/binary/predictions.png" width="100%" style="margin: auto;"/>

The head activation is replaced with a sigmoid, which returns an independent probability for each bit.

### Advantages

Just [like the previous iteration of tokun](tokun.md) this scheme solves most tokenization shortcomings.
Plus:

- **token length**: the token length can be freely chosen, it is **now a hyper-parameter**
- **straightforward**: there is no need for extra preprocessing or training
- **optimizations** (minor): the kernels of the input and output layers are smaller
- **correlation**: there is a direct match between predictions and text composition

You'll find more details in the [comparison section](#comparison-with-tokenization).

In particular, the last point has wide ranging implications:
for example, digits are encoded as `48 + d` in Unicode, hence number representation is shifted but preserved.

## Tokenization And Ancient Languages

Essentially, tokenization merges individual characters (bytes) into **monolithic chunks**.
Here, 56 cyrillic characters are grouped into 20 tokens:

<img src=".images/tiktoken/russian.gpt4o.png" width="75%" style="margin: auto;"/>

LLMs are only aware of the index values on the right side and lose the information about the original composition of these tokens.

Imagine having a unique symbol for every number and word variation, like [communicating with emojis only][twitter-karpathy-emojis]!

Early written languages, such as hieroglyphs, were based on such logograms: symbols representing whole concepts.
However, they still had rebus rules to form nuanced meanings out of combinations of symbols.

For instance, to form the plural in Egyptian hieroglyphs you could triple a logogram or add 3 bars next to it:
"house" is "ìâê" and "houses" is "ìâê ìè™".

In contrast, the popular tokenizer o200k has " house" (4276), " House" (7826), "house" (9983), " houses" (20327), "House" (27796), "-house" (46400) etc.

This approach overlooks how modern languages derive meaning from **combinations of symbols**.

In particular, phonetic and positional systems allow to compose words and numbers.
And the composition of a word gives many indications on its meaning.

In all three domains mentioned earlier, macro elements break down into simpler parts.
For text, the different scales are roughly:

- computer science: sequences &#8594; codepoints &#8594; bytes &#8594; bits
- mathematics: tensors &#8594; axes &#8594; dimensions
- linguistics: paragraphs &#8594; sentences &#8594; words &#8594; symbols / letters

Tokenization cuts the decomposition short: it stops between sequences and codepoints on the computer side, which is somewhere between sentences and graphemes for linguistics.

To keep the compositional expressiveness, we'll start over from the fundamental graphemes.

## Unicode Embeddings

On a computer, the language units are translated into numbers by the Unicode standard.
It is universal, with 149813 symbols from 161 scripts.

Most digital text is expressed in this standard, including this very web page.

### Codepoint Embeddings

And traditional tokenization algorithms like BPE start from Unicode.
As the name Byte Pair Encoding suggests, it generates new indices by merging characters two by two.

The vocabulary of o200K was created by iterating this process on the most frequent pairs in a training set.
So each index in o200k is equivalent to the underlying sequence of Unicode codepoints:

| Position      | Token         | o200k     | UTF-32-BE                                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0             | `M`           | `44`      | `(77)`                                    |
| 1             | `inds`        | `13834`   | `(105, 110, 100, 115)`                    |
| 2             | ` aren't`     | `23236`   | `(32, 97, 114, 101, 110, 39, 116)`        |
| 3             | ` read`       | `1729`    | `(32, 114, 101, 97, 100)`                 |
| 4             | `.`           | `13`      | `(46)`                                    |
| ...           | ...           | ...       | ...                                       |

Now that all the indexes are Unicode, there is no reason to keep the uneven chunks:

| Position  | Chunk         | UTF-32-BE             | Embeddings                                            |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | `Mind`        | `(77, 105, 110, 100)` | `(0.00029373, 0.00040054, 0.00041962, 0.00038147)`    |
| 1         | `s ar`        | `(115, 32, 97, 114)`  | `(0.00043869, 0.00012207, 0.00037003, 0.00043488)`    |
| 2         | `en't`        | `(101, 110, 39, 116)` | `(0.00038528, 0.00041962, 0.00014877, 0.0004425 )`    |
| 3         | ` rea`        | `(32, 114, 101, 97)`  | `(0.00012207, 0.00043488, 0.00038528, 0.00037003)`    |
| ...       | ...           | ...                   | ...                                                   |

This operation might look banal, but we moved data **from the sequence axis to the feature axis**!
Now, the table is looking like an actual embedding tensor!

After normalizing the values, the codepoints can be directly treated as embeddings.
And the "tokens" can be made arbitrarily long:

| Position  | Chunk             | UTF-32-BE                                 | Embeddings                                                                    |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | `Minds ar`        | `(77, 105, 110, 100, 115, 32, 97, 114)`   | `(2.94e-4, 4.01e-4, 4.20e-4, 3.81e-4, 4.39e-4, 1.22e-4, 3.70e-4, 4.35e-4)`    |
| 1         | `en't rea`        | `(101, 110, 39, 116, 32, 114, 101, 97)`   | `(3.85e-4, 4.20e-4, 1.49e-4, 4.43e-4, 1.22e-4, 4.35e-4, 3.85e-4, 3.70e-4)`    |
| ...       | ...               | ...                                       | ...                                                                           |

Now the length of the sequence chunks ("tokens") is a hyper-parameter like the number of layers in a model.

These vectors have a lot of information embedded.
Dimensionality reduction shows how the vectors made from similar characters are close:

| PCA                       | UMAP                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ![][image-pca-codepoints] | ![][image-umap-codepoints]   |

Since the standard organizes the Unicode space into themed ranges of values, the embeddings are natively correlated with content.
For example there are regions for each character set (Latin, Cyrillic, etc), for emojis, for symbols, for special characters, etc.

These normalized embeddings can serve as input tensor for a LLM.
The model can then extend the embedding dimension for further processing.

This scheme inherits from the properties of Unicode and has already most of the advantages [listed in the TL;DR](#tl-dr).

Still, there is a lot to improve too:

- brittle: the embedding values are very precise and they are separated by `1 / 0x40000 = 3.8147-06` only
- linear: the embeddings are regularly spaced even though certain codepoints have very different meanings from their neighbors
- expensive: there are 262144 "basic" elements, which is **not** an improvement over regular vocabularies

### Byte Embeddings

The decomposition can be pushed further: the 32 bits of each Unicode codepoint can be split into bytes.

| Position  | Chunk         | UTF-32-BE                                                     | Embeddings                                                                |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | `Mind`        | `(0, 0, 0,  77, 0, 0, 0, 105, 0, 0, 0, 110, 0, 0, 0, 100)`    | `(0 0 0 0.30078125 0 0 0 0.41015625 0 0 0 0.4296875 0 0 0 0.390625)`      |
| 1         | `s ar`        | `(0, 0, 0, 115, 0, 0, 0,  32, 0, 0, 0,  97, 0, 0, 0, 114)`    | `(0 0 0 0.44921875 0 0 0 0.125 0 0 0 0.37890625 0 0 0 0.4453125)`         |
| 2         | `en't`        | `(0, 0, 0, 101, 0, 0, 0, 110, 0, 0, 0,  39, 0, 0, 0, 116)`    | `(0 0 0 0.39453125 0 0 0 0.4296875 0 0 0 0.15234375 0 0 0 0.453125)`      |
| 3         | ` rea`        | `(0, 0, 0,  32, 0, 0, 0, 114, 0, 0, 0, 101, 0, 0, 0,  97)`    | `(0 0 0 0.125 0 0 0 0.4453125 0 0 0 0.39453125 0 0 0 0.37890625)`         |
| ...       | ...           | ...                                                           | ...                                                                       |

Dividing by 256 is now enough to preform the normalization.
And the structure of Unicode is even more apparent with these embeddings:

| PCA                  | UMAP                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ![][image-pca-bytes] | ![][image-umap-bytes]  |

This transformation solves 2 of the shortcomings of the previous method:

- reduced complexity: embeddings are now derived from 256 base elements instead of 200k
- increased separation: byte values are further apart in the embedding space

Still, the embeddings are lineary distributed.
It would be better to distinguish special values, in particular the null byte.

## Composite Embeddings

Actually, the integer bytes can be interpreted as an index in a traditional embedding layer.
After concatening the embeddings from each byte, a "token" embedding is formed:

<img src=".images/composite/embeddings.png" width="100%" style="margin: auto;"/>

Even when the embeddings for each byte are initialized randomly, the merged embeddings keep the information on token composition:

| PCA                       | UMAP                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ![][image-pca-composite]  | ![][image-umap-composite]     |

Now, the "token" length is **a hyper-parameter of the model**.
For example, the Gemma2-27B architecture could be tweaked like this:

- the embed dimension `E` is kept at 4608
- the token dimension `T` is set to 32 (bytes, which amount to 8 Unicode characters)
- the byte dimension `C` is then 4608 / 32 = 144

With this setup, an input tensor with a batch dimension `B` of 128 and sequence dimension of 16384 (4096 characters) would be:

- first reshaped as `(B, S / T, T) = (128, 256, 64)`
- and exit the composite embedding layer as a tensor of shape `(B, S / T, T * C) = (128, 256, 4608)`

The LLM would process the input as a sequence of 256 embeddings, each representing 8 characters.
And each of these embeddings is formed by concatenating 32 byte embeddings.

This layer can then be trained and the embeddings for each byte can be adjusted by the model.
It allows the model to set an independent meaning to each byte, contrary to the two schemes in the sections above.

Finally the LLM is aware of the composition of each token through its embedding.
It can natively perform calculations, create and understand neologisms, etc.

## Binary Predictions

Since the format of the inputs changed, the targets should have a matching representation.

Let's get back to the current models (as of 2024) and suppose GPT-4o processed the following sentence:

```
This paper was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014.[11]
```

For each position in the sequence, the model evaluates the probability of every single token.

Given everything before the token "201" the probability vector might look like this:

| Index         | 0     | ...   | 290       | ...   | 667   | ...   | 1179  | ...   | 1323  | ...   | 34902         | ...   | 199,997   |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------------- | ----- | --------- |
| Token         | `!`   | ...   | ` the`    | ...   | `201` | ...   | `200` | ...   | `202` | ...   | ` september`  | ...   | ` cocos`  |
| Target        | 0     | ...   | 0         | ...   | 1     | ...   | 0     | ...   | 0     | ...   | 0             | ...   | 0         |
| Prediction    | 0     | ...   | 0.15      | ...   | 0.4   | ...   | 0.1   | ...   | 0.25  | ...   | 0.08          | ...   | 0         |

This one-hot vector has a **dimension of 200k** and is usually obtained with either:

- a softmax activation
- dot projection on the embedding vectors

Instead, every number below 200k can be represented with **just 18 bits**.
The target index `667` for the next token "201" is `110110010100000000` in base 2.

Each bit can be predicted by an **independent probability** by switching the activation from softmax to a **sigmoid**:

| Index         | 0     | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     | 9     | 10    | 11    | 12    | 13    | 14    | 15    | 16    | 17    |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Target        | 1     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| Prediction    | 0.6   | 0.58  | 0.55  | 0.7   | 0.64  | 0.37  | 0.2   | 0.8   | 0.25  | 0.9   | 0.08  | 0.12  | 0.04  | 0.1   | 0.02  | 0     | 0     | 0     |

The binary vector above encodes the prediction "671": 
With this scheme, prediction errors are numerically close, because each bit only contributes to a portion of the prediction.

Unfortunately, the vocabulary of tokenizers are chaotic: **numeric proximity** is unrelated to **semantic similarity**.
For example, the tokens surrounding "201" in o200k are: " can", "–ø", " me", " —Å", b"\xe0\xb3".

Again, the Unicode representation proves useful as targets.
Like the input tensor, the targets can be shaped as a tensor of `(B, S / T, T)` bytes.
Then, each byte prediction is a vector of dimension 8 (bits) and the final output is `(B, S / T, 8 * T)`.

With `L = 8`, the whole process is:

<img src=".images/binary/predictions.png" width="100%" style="margin: auto;"/>

For the patch of text "201", the target prediction would be:

- `(0, 0, 0, 50, 0, 0, 0, 48, 0, 0, 0, 49)` in bytes
- or `(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)` as final binary target for the byte `49`

As you can see, the 3 bytes to predict -48, 49 and 50- are close like the characters they represent.
Even with errors in the binary outputs, the predictions would not land far.

Now that the model's output align with the input's binary nature, we can explore how these changes impact the model's performance.

## Comparison With Tokenization

The hyper parameters are set for all the comparisons below:

- the reference tokenizer is o200k
- batch dimension: `B = 128`
- sequence dimension: `S = 32,768` characters
- token dimension: `T = 64`
- embedding dimensions:
    - for each byte: `E = 64`
    - inside the model: `H = 4096`

### Consistency

Token sizes are irregular, while UTF-32-BE allows to group bytes into **fixed size chunks**.
The number of characters covered by each embedding becomes a **tunable hyper-parameter**.

Also, the vocabularies of tokenizers depend on the training data:

- token frequencies change with time: dates, proper nouns, events, slang, etc
- training data is often limited:
    - geographically, to a few languages
    - by the lexical field, because of the context

While Unicode is **timeless and universal**.

### Compression

#### Embedding Weights

The kernel of composite embeddings has a shape `(256, E)`, here `(256, 64)`.
In contrast, the kernel for the vocabulary o200k is `(199998, H)`, which is `(199998, 4096)`.

The latter kernel requires enormous amounts of data so that each token in the vocabulary is witnessed in several contexts.
On the contrary, all the byte values are seen in countless combinations, each will get a solid training.

Also, the composite embedding kernels have 50000 times less parameters.

#### Projection Weights

Similarly, the projection layers are shaped:

- `(199998, H) = (199998, 4096)` in case of a dot-product and the transpose for a softmax head
- `(H, 8 * T) = (4096, 512)` with the sigmoid activation for binary predictions

The head is 400 times smaller too.

#### Weights Of The Inner Layers

Howver, the scope of inputs and outputs is greatly expanded to cover all modern languages.
While the impact of this expansion is difficult to quantify, my experience indicates that it requires a larger model.

To match the performance of token-based models, I had to increase by about 1.5 times the embedding dimension in the inner layers.

Consequently, while composite embeddings reduce the size of input and output kernels, the **overall model often ends up with more parameters**.

#### Inputs

The sequence dimension `S = 32,768` leads to:

- a context dimension of `C = 8,192` with tokenization (on average, with o200k, for the purpose of comparing)
- a sequence of `4 * S = 131,072` bytes

After embedding, the input tensors are:

- `(8192, 4096)` with tokenization
- `(4 * S / T, 4096) = (2048, 4096)` with composite embeddings

The composite embeddings are a combination of `T = 64` vectors of dimension `E = 64` for a total of 4096.

While UTF-32 temporarily expands the input sequence, it is then reduced into a smaller tensor.

#### Outputs

Finally, the outputs are significantly smaller:

- `(8192, 199998)` with tokenization
- `(4 * S / T, 8 * T) = (2048, 512)` with binary predictions

Binary prediction 1600 times smaller and very dense in comparison.

### Prediction Errors

With tokenization:

- a prediction is a whole subword, taken from a vocabulary
- tokens are listed in a chaotic order, and neighbors are unrelated
- the numeric error spans the whole output dimension (vocabulary size)

With binary predictions:

- the next chunk of text is predicted one byte at a time
- bytes are ordered according to the Unicode std, which is very structured
- each prediction bit contributes to a portion of the prediction / error

So if the next token was `e`, the target would be:

- a one-hot vector with a 1 at index `327`, for a model with tokenizer (199997 zeros and a one)
- `(0, 0, 0, 101)` or `((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1))` in binary

And a wrong prediction would be respectively:

- index 328 or ` of`
- `((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1))` or `(0, 0, 0, 103)` for `g`

From my experience the model rarely fails to predict the null bytes (even with a class weights `0.3`).

To sum up:

- the errors on token predictions are random
- binary errors are in the neighborhood of the target, which means that it is similar thanks to Unicode
- token predictions are always meaningful subwords
- while byte level predictions can have "typos" in the middle

So there are pros and cons to both approaches.

## Implementations

I'll only provide Tensorflow / Keras implementations here.
Look at the [resource section](#resources) for the PyTorch version and more.

### Composite Embeddings

The composite embeddings can be implemented in a very simple layer.
For example, in Keras:

```python
@keras.saving.register_keras_serializable(package='layers')
class TokunEmbedding(keras.layers.Embedding):
    def call(self, inputs: keras.Input) -> keras.Input:
        # embed each element separately
        __outputs = super(TokunEmbedding, self).call(inputs)
        # concatenate the embeddings
        return keras.ops.einsum('bste -> bs(te)', __outputs)
```

The `einsum` operation could be replaced with a more generic "merge" operation independent of the rank of its input.
For example, the `einsum` equation could be generated according to the rank of the input:

```python
def _equation(self, inputs: keras.Input) -> str:
    __rank = len(keras.ops.shape(inputs))
    __indices = [chr(97 + __i) for __i in range(__rank + 1)] # embedding adds an axis
    return '{} -> {}({})'.format(''.join(__indices), ''.join(__indices[:-2]), ''.join(__indices[-2:]))
```

### Binary Predictions

The targets for the binary predictions are calculated by decomposing the inputs in base 2.
For example in Tensorflow:

```python
def expand_base(data: tf.Tensor, base: int, depth: int, bigendian: bool=True) -> tf.Tensor:
    __shape = len(list(data.shape)) * [1] + [depth]
    # base indexes
    __idx = range(depth)[::-1] if bigendian else range(depth)
    # base divisor and moduli
    __div = tf.convert_to_tensor([base ** __e for __e in __idx], dtype=data.dtype)
    __mod = tf.convert_to_tensor([base ** (__e + 1) for __e in __idx], dtype=data.dtype)
    # match the input shape
    __div = tf.reshape(__div, shape=__shape)
    __mod = tf.reshape(__mod, shape=__shape)
    # Euclidean algorithm
    __digits = tf.math.floordiv(x=tf.math.floormod(x=tf.expand_dims(data, axis=-1), y=__mod), y=__div)
    # format
    return tf.cast(__digits, dtype=data.dtype)
```

During inference, the predictions can be interpreted by doing the reverse operation:

```python
def reduce_base(data: tf.Tensor, base: int, axis: int=-1, keepdims: bool=False, bigendian: bool=True) -> tf.Tensor:
    __rank = len(data.shape)
    # select the dimension of the given axis
    __shape = [__d if (__i - axis) % __rank == 0 else 1 for __i, __d in enumerate(list(data.shape))]
    # exponents
    __exp = range(__shape[axis])[::-1] if bigendian else range(__shape[axis])
    # base multipliers
    __base = tf.convert_to_tensor([base ** __e for __e in __exp], dtype=data.dtype)
    # match the input shape
    __base = tf.reshape(__base, shape=__shape)
    # recompose the number
    return tf.reduce_sum(data * __base, axis=axis, keepdims=keepdims)
```

## Next

With these input and output representations, LLM have a finer and wider understanding of text.
It may come at the cost of an expansion in the inner layers though.

To get a better sense of the practical value of composite embeddings, I built a serie of models called `llaminate`.
In particular, I may write a short review of a neural compiler that came out of this project.
